# Introduction
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty.

In this project, I will be focusing on utilizing unsupervised learning techniques and methods to analyze and categorize countries based on critical socio-economic and health factors.

By looking into metrics such as child mortality rates, health spending, GDP per capita, inflation, and fertility rates, I try to find patterns and insights that can help with decision-making. The goal is to create meaningful clusters that highlight nations most in need of aid.

Before we head to EDA, here are the features of this dataset:

Data Attributes/Features
country: Name of the country.
child_mort: Deaths of children under 5 years of age per 1,000 live births.
exports: Exports of goods and services per capita, expressed as a percentage of GDP per capita.
health: Total health spending per capita, expressed as a percentage of GDP per capita.
imports: Imports of goods and services per capita, expressed as a percentage of GDP per capita.
income: Net income per person.
inflation: Annual growth rate of the total GDP.
life_expec: Average number of years a newborn child is expected to live, based on current mortality patterns.
total_fer: Number of children that would be born to each woman if current age-fertility rates remain unchanged.
gdpp: GDP per capita, calculated as total GDP divided by total population.
